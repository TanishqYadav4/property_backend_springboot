Act -1 

Narrator :  
 
Ladies and Gentlemen , gather near !  
A tale of dreams and dread you’ll hear…. 
Of circuits and codes our hero’s plight,  
an engineer with goals in sight…… 
 
Meet young Tanishq, with a mind so keen, 
in classrooms bright he’s always seen… 
with algorithms and math he’s grand, 
yet in interviews, he can’t quite land…. 
 
A job he seeks in software’s realm, 
but rejections stop his ship’s helm, 
With every no , his hopes do shrink, 
yet on he goes , with dreams in sync…. 
 
he has coded apps and debugged woes, 
but company’s doors, they firmly close…. 
“Oh why” , he cries , “must this be so”, 
“Is my fate sealed with a fatal blow ?” 
 
Watch as his journey takes its course, 
through trials, laughs and some remorse, 
for in each rejection, a lesson he finds, 
in humor’s light , his spirit shines…… 
 
so sit back, laugh and do not fret, 
for Tanishq has not met his  moment yet 
a story of persistence , grit and cheer 
begins right now , so lend an ear…….. 
 
[ Conversation starts ]  
 
[ Shru comes in with a newspaper, and sees a depressed Tanishq ] 

 

Shru : 
  Hey Tanishq Bro ! Is everything okay ? 
 

Tanishq : 
  Does everything look okay to you ?  
 
Shru : 
  Relaax , man ! Look , I don’t mean to pry , and if you don’t wanna say anything , that’s fine by me. But I’m just trying to help.  
 
Tanishq : 
  I’m sorry for lashing out at you.   You know how it is . Typical engineering problems.  
Companies are coming in with lavish job opportunities , and like countless other students I’m applying for them. I’m getting shortlisted , but I’ve had no luck so far in getting through and having a job offer. I’m not sure what’s going wrong. I’m not sure what they want from me.  
 
Shru : 
 Yeah , I can understand . But get this , you can fail a hundred times , you only have to succeed once. Maybe all of these rejections are but stepping stones , that are paving your way for that one selection.  
 
Tanishq : 
 You know , I’ve heard stuff like this a million times before . What you’re saying may be right , but its not practical . Nobody’s got time , or the strength enough to fail a thousand times and still manage to get back up. It all seems futile to me.  
 
Shru :  
Bro , you’ve heard stuff like this , because however impractical sayings like this may seem to you at the moment , at the end of the day , they’re all true. And besides , you don’t have any options at the moment . Better to man up, and face it head on. 
[ Pause ]  
 Anyways , any new companies you’ve applied for recently ?  
 
Tanishq : 
Yeah . I’ve given the online assessment for a company called Natwest yesterday. 
 
Shru : 
Oh , I’ve heard about it. Aren’t they the ones that sponsor the English cricket team ? 
 

Tanishq : I guess.  
[ Tanishq phone rings . A notification pops up on Tanishq’s phone ] 
 oh , what do you know about that ? I AM shortlisted for the interview , and its in half-an-hour. I better hurry ….. 
[ Tanishq gets up and walks away ] 
 
Shru :  
Best of luck , my man. Let me know what happens.

Act -2 
[ Scene of an interview ] 
Narrator :  
 
In the interview room, the tension was high 
our hero buckled up , giving it a try 
the interviewer smiled , with questions to fly 
a battle of wits beneath the office sky 
 
“ Tell me your skills, “ the interviewer pressed 
Tanishq listed them , trying his best 
With each new question , he grew more stressed 
Hoping the answers would leave them impressed  
 
 
 
HR : 
Good afternoon , Tanishq . Firstly , I’d like to know more about you. Please introduce yourself . 
 
Tanishq :  
Certainly , sir. I’m Tanishq , an aspiring software engineer with a knack for coding and a PHD in surviving interviews. When I’m not debugging code, I’m usually debugging my life , which nowadays involves finding out new ways to hear , “we’ll get back to you .”  
I’ve built apps, solved countess DSA problems , and I’m here today because I believe your company’s vision aligns perfectly with my skills , and I promise not to crash your servers – at least not on the first day . { Awkward laugh }  
 
HR : I’ll be on the lookout for that. So , moving ahead , I’d like to ask you another question ,  
“If you had to write a book about your life so far , what would the title be and why “ ? 
 
Tanishq :  
It would be : “ NP-Hard : A naive approach to optimizing life“ . 
The title alludes to the method of formulating the solution of a computational problem ,which involves first coming up with a solution that is correct , but not efficient , and then slowly and steadily improving the solution so that it can hit both of those marks. I’ve learnt from the tough ordeal of interviews that it’s not about being the best , but about persevering against the odds , and I would surely want my book to convey that message.  
 
HR : That surely is one way to answer that question {Laughs } We’ll get back to you.

Act – 3 
 
[ Tanishq eagerly waiting for the results ]  
 
Narrator :  
in his hostel room , nerves on high,  
he waits for his next email , sigh.  
Did he dazzle, did he flop?  
will they say “yes”, or will his heart drop?  
 
Refresh , refresh his finger’s sore…. 
come on inbox, what’s in store?  
A job, a dream, a hopeful cheer…. 
or just another “thanks, not here “….. 
 
[ Tanishq gets an email; He read and is elated]  
 
Tanishq : Hallelujah ! Finally ! May the gods above be praised in all their glory ! Now ...... 
[ takes a deep breath ] okay , calm down . First I gotta break the news to my bros.  
 
[ Tanishq calls Shru ] 
 
Tanishq : Dude , guess what ? I got the job!  
 
Shru : No way ! That’s awesome ! You mean you actually convinced someone to hire you ? Did they not check your interview history ? 
 

Tanishq : I know , right ? I was beginning to think that my resume was cursed. But seriously , sometimes the only thing that saves you from complete breakdown is a kind word from a friend.  
 
Shru : Well , what did I say ? It was just a matter of time . Just remember , with great power comes great responsibility. And by great responsibility , I mean not pushing faulty code to production on your first day . 
 
Tanishq :  [laughs]  I’ll keep that in mind. 
 
Shru : Anyways ,  have a good one , brother ! 
 
Tanishq : Thanks , man , for everything.

Act –2  
 
Narrator :  
 
Looming ahead , a new challenge arose  
a bootcamp online where learning flows 
no classmates to meet , no campus to roam, 
just zoom meetings , taken from home 
 
Tanishq sighed , feeling a bit forlorn 
yearning for a break from digital thorn 
studying online is a daunting feat 
but our hero is determined , never one to retreat 
 
so buckle up, folks ! For the ride’s just begun,  
as Tanishq dives headfirst into the corporate sun..... 
With bootcamps , hackathons and challenges galore 
will he emerge victorious ? Lets' explore ! 
 
 
Trainer: Good morning, everyone! Welcome to our bootcamp.  
I am Anjali and I’ll be your trainer for bootcamp. 
Over the next two months, we'll have nine-hour sessions daily. There will be assignments, hackathons, and assessments. Its going to be challenging but this is going to really help you in your future projects. We’ll be learning about various front-end frameworks like Angular and React, back-end frameworks like Springboot , and all of this will be project-driven and hands-on. 
 
[Trainer about to leave] 

Tanishq: 
 Did you hear that? Nine hours a day! 

  

Student 2: 

 (sighing) And hackathons too? I barely survived the last one. 

  

Trainer: You'll learn a lot, and this experience will be invaluable for your careers. I know it's rigorous but stay motivated! 
Also we’ll have a senior checker dropping in during the classes to check on your progress. 

  

[Trainer exits. Slide showing –’few days later’. 
 Students turn to each other] 

  

Tanishq: 
 So, how are you coping up with all this? 

  

Student 2: Barely. I’ve already got dark circles from the assignments. And we haven't even started the hackathons yet. 

  

Tanishq: (laughs) Tell me about it. My coffee consumption has tripled! 

  

[Suddenly, the Senior Checker bursts in (zoom meeting in slide) with exaggerated movements, adjusting their glasses and scanning the room with a comically serious expression] 

  

Senior Checker: (in a funny tone) Alright, team! Cameras on! I need to see those smiling faces. (looks around) Why the sad faces? Are we here for a bootcamp or a boot-fun camp? 

   

Tanishq: (sarcastically) Oh yes, we’re having a blast. 

  

Senior Checker: (mockingly serious) I see some enthusiasm here! Keep it up, soldiers! Remember, a happy coder is a productive coder. (winks) 
 

Student 2: (under their breath) More like a sleepy coder. 

  

Senior Checker:  

(pretending not to hear) I sense some whispers of joy. Keep spreading that positive energy! Alright, back to work, folks. 

  

 

[Time passes. The Trainer re-enters the classroom with a proud smile.] 

  

Trainer: 

 We’ve come close to the end of our bootcamp. Today, you have your final project presentations. Your mentors and managers will be there, so give it your best shot. Good luck! 

 

  

[ the project presentation commences ]  
 
Tanishq :  
Good day , everyone ! Today , my teammate Mamta and I are excited to share our project – the multi-currency account solution. Using React , Springboot ad MongoDB , we’ve built a tool that makes handling different currencies a breeze.... 
 
Mamta : 
Imagine this : You’re travelling abroad , and suddenly you need to pay in a different currency. The conventional account lets you only hold amount of a certain currency , but our project lets you have amounts of different currencies in a single account .  
 
Tanishq: 
With our solution . You can perform intra-account as well as inter-account money transfers , check for currency alerts , and all that a conventional bank account lets you do , only much more. Behind the scenes , Springboot backend manages the heavy lifting , while React makes our product look spick and span.  
 
Mamta : 
Thank you for joining us , and we hope you find our showcases both informative and useful. 
 

Trainer:  

Congratulations everyone, you all did an amazing job. Your managers and mentors were impressed. 
 
Tanishq:  

I can't believe we did it. All those intense sessions really paid off. 

 

Mamta:  

I feel like I learnt so much in short time. Remember how we were freaking out about 9 hr sessions, now it feels like we can handle anything! 

 

Tanishq: 
 And those hackathons seemed impossible at first, but they turned out to be some of the best learning experiences. 

 

Mamta:  

Agreed. Its been tough but we have learnt so much more than we ever thought possible.
